          The Dai System and Software is an autonomous system of smart contracts on the
          Ethereum Blockchain (the Open Source Software), that permits, among other things, the generation of Dai.
          Dai is a cryptocurrency intended to maintain low volatility that is available at dai.makerdao.com and via
          other tools (the Site) â€” which includes text, images, audio, code and other materials (collectively, the
          Content) and all of the features, and services provided. The Site, and any other features, tools,
          materials, the Open Source Software, or other services offered from time to time are referred to here as
          the Service. Note however, that while the Open Source Software is intended to maintain low volatility for
          Dai, the Open Source Software is an experimental prototype and its use involves a high degree of risk. There
          are numerous ways the Open Source Software and Service could fail in an unexpected way, resulting in the
          total and absolute loss of all of your funds
